  Processing.js is an open programming language for people who want to program
  images, animation, and interactions for the web without using Flash or Java
  applets. Processing.js uses Javascript to draw shapes and manipulate images
  on the HTML5 Canvas element. The code is light-weight, simple to learn and
  makes an ideal tool for visualizing data, creating user-interfaces and
  developing web-based games.

  Processing.js is explicitly developed for browsers that support the HTML5
  <Canvas> element. Processing.js runs in FireFox, Safari, Opera and Chrome but
  will not be supported in Internet Explorer until Mircosoft catch up with
  ISSUE 15.

  Implementing Processing.js in Flash or Silverlight is not recommended as Java
  already occupies the browser-plug-in space for this library. For users
  wishing to run Processing.js in Silverlight, see Paul Irish's Silverlight
  implementation. Using Explorer Canvas with Processing.js typically results in
  unusable frame-rates for moderately complex visualizations.

  The Processing language was created by Ben Fry and Casey Reas. It evolved
  from ideas explored in the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media
  Lab and was originally intended to be used in a Java run-time environment. In
  the Summer of 2008, John Resig ( inventor of jQuery ), ported the 2D context
  of Processing to Javascript for use in web pages. Much like the native
  language, Processing.js is a community driven project, and continues to grow
  as browser technology advances.

  PLATFORM AND BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
  Processing.js is explicitly developed for browsers that support the HTML5 Canvas
  element. Processing.js runs in FireFox, Safari, Opera and Chrome but is not 
  currently supported in Internet Explorer. Processing.js aims for 100% 
  compatibility across all supported browsers however differences between 
  individual canvas implementations may give slightly different results in your 
  sketches.

  Processing.js is actively tested on the following platforms and browsers:  

           Fx  Sf  Ch  Op  IE
